### EDFA_Gain_Modelling

This repository contains all the materials related to the dissertation project on **"EDFA Gain Modeling using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)."** The research focuses on developing a DNN model to accurately predict the gain characteristics of Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) across 95 channels in Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems. The primary goal is to enhance prediction accuracy and improve the efficiency of optical communication networks.

#### Repository Highlights:

- **Deep Learning Architecture:**
  - The DNN model uses a four-layer architecture with Leaky ReLU activation functions, designed to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships in EDFA gain prediction.

- **Robust Performance:**
  - The model was trained on a dataset of 3.1 GB and evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with training accuracy reaching 98.5%.

- **Scalability and Generalization:**
  - The research includes cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well across unseen test data, making it a scalable solution for real-world applications.
